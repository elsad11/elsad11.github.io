<h1>Elsa's Journal</h1>
<h2> Journal Entry 1 </h2>
<p> HTML is a tag based language, meaning it embeds code with common start and stop characters. HTML is more visual than other coding languages, which I enjoy. I started by learning to create divs, as well as add gifs and writing in my code. The class has been great so far, and I am excited to continue learning more on HTML.</p>

<h2> Journal Entry 2 </h2>
<p> I have continued to enjoy HTML and this computer science class. I like the creative aspect we use, and designing our own website gives us creative freedom. I have started to learn more on creating buttons, changing styles, sizes, and colors of text, as well as how to publish my website using Github and update it using terminal. </p>

<h2> Journal Entry 3 </h2>
<p>For my animation code, I added a div that enabled the menu bar of my website to go through the colors of the rainbow for an infinite amount of time. This code worked because I created a new div in my style section of my code, set its color, size (which ended up not mattering), and animation duration and amount of times played. I then used a keyframes example to make the colors continuously change between themselves. Because these codes were under the style code with the menu, it transferred this code into that of the menu. </p>

<h2> Journal Entry 4 </h2>
<p>In my hearts project, I created a variable for my hearts, that allowed it to continue adding a heart to the screen 500 times, using a function that repeated, called makePumpkin. </p>

<h2> Journal Entry 5 </h2>
<p>In my music project, I created an event listener that responded to clicks. Each time I clicked, it would count the amount of clicks. When the clicks were even, the song would pause, and a play picture would show up on the screen. When the click amounts were odd, the song would play and a paus picture would show up on the screen. I used an Mp3 to add my song to my code. </p>

<h2> Journal Entry 6 </h2>
<p>In my gallery project, I used a template from urbanature, and created a gallery that showed cats with different emotions. My creating a function that created a square, I was able to easily choose how many pictures I wanted to add. I named all the cat pictures in my folder with a number and .jpg, so I could add a variable called placeholder that would easily add all the pictures by increasing the number in front of the .jpg each time. </p>

<h2> Journal Entry 7 </h2>
<p>In my array project, I was inspired by the closet scene in Clueless. By clicking my div, a random number (which I had to make sure was not a decimal), would trigger a different shirt to pop up using the pngs in my folder. </p>

<h2> Journal Entry 8 </h2>
<p>In my valentines day card project, I created love letter divs that when you clicked on them, they changed to valentines day gifs. In my code, I used inspiration from my gallery project, where I made a function called MakeSquare, that would create as many letters as I chose, and added an event listener that made it so when I would click the div, it would change the background image of the square from the letter to the gif. </p>
