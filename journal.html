<h1> Journal Entry 1 </h1>
<p>HTML is a tag based language, meaning it embeds code with common start and stop characters. HTML is more visual than other coding languages, which I enjoy. </p>

<h2> Journal Entry 2 </h2>
<p>I have been enjoying HTML and this computer science class a lot so far. I like the creative aspect we use, and designing our own website gives us creative freedom as well as challenges me in my debugging problem solving and on my knowledge of websites, divs, and design. </p>
