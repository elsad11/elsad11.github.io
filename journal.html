<h1> Journal Entry 1 </h1>
<p style="font-size: 25px"> HTML is a tag based language, meaning it embeds code with common start and stop characters. HTML is more visual than other coding languages, which I enjoy. I started by learning to create divs, as well as add gifs and writing in my code. The class has been great so far, and I am excited to continue learning more on HTML.</p>

<h2> Journal Entry 2 </h2>
<p style="font-size: 25px"> I have continued to enjoy HTML and this computer science class. I like the creative aspect we use, and designing our own website gives us creative freedom. I have started to learn more on creating buttons, changing styles, sizes, and colors of text, as well as how to publish my website and update it using terminal. </p>
